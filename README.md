# HoGRC
Higher-order Granger reservoir computing

This repository contains the code for the paper:
- [Higher-order Granger reservoir computing: Simultaneously achieving structures inference and accurate prediction of complex dynamics]

In this work, we formulate a new dynamic inference and prediction framework based on reservior computing and Granger causality. 
Our framework can not only accurately infer the higher-order structures of the system, but also significantly outperforms the baseline methods in prediction tasks. 

This respository provides HoGRC methods implemented in PyTorch. And the experimental data can be generated through code.

## Environment 
To run this project, we will need to set up an environment with Python 3 and install the following Python packages:
- Python 3.9.7
- joblib 1.3.2
- matplotlib 3.8.2
- numpy 1.26.2
- pandas 2.1.4
- scipy 1.11.4
- scikit-learn 1.3.2
- torch 2.1.2
- torchdiffeq 0.2.3

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples
- 'An_Example_for_Task_1.py' serves as an example for inferring the high-order neighbors of node z in the Loren63 system, and the results are displayed in Fig. 2a in the main text.
```python
python -m An_Example_for_Task_1
```
- 'An_Example_for_Task_2.py' serves as an example for prediction of the coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo system using different methods, and the results are displayed in Figs. 3a and 3c in the main text.
```python
python -m An_Example_for_Task_2
```
