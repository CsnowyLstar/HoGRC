# HoGRC
Higher-order Granger reservoir computing

This repository contains the code for the paper:
- [(HoGRC) Higher-order Granger reservoir computing: Simultaneously achieving structures inference and accurate prediction of complex dynamics]

In this work, we formulate a new dynamic inference and prediction framework based on reservior computing and Granger causality. 
Our framework can not only accurately infer the higher-order structures of the system, but also significantly outperforms the baseline methods in prediction tasks. 

This respository provides HoGRC methods implemented in PyTorch. And the experimental data can be generated through code.
