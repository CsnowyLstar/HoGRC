When conducting experiments on the power grid, the working directory should be set to the current folder.

Firstly, execute "gen_data.py" to generate the dataset. 

Following this, implement dynamic forecasting by running one of the following files: "HCO_HoGRC.py", "HCO_PRC.py", or "HCO_RC.py". 

Additionally, the file "HCO_HoGRC_stru.py" can be utilized for structural inference, where varying higher-order structures can be specified to evaluate the predictive error.
